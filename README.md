if you don't have docker and docker-compose installed, please follow this guide.
https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/ or https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/ (in case of windows)

1. go to frontend folder, then use npm install
2. go to project's root folder, then use command 'docker-compose up --build -d'
3. after the docker's processes finished, go to the local website at 'http://localhost'

if you have any error, please email me in shortly as possible.
